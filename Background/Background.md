# The Issues Surrounding Aging Populations in Rural Communities in Nova Scotia

## PROBLEM CONTEXT

Nova Scotia has one of the oldest populations in Canada. The challenges that seniors face in communities include limited access to healthcare, social isolation, inadequate methods of public transportation, and a shortage of nursing and long-term care facilities (Government of Nova Scotia, 2022). These issues can have immense effects on their quality of life, leading to increased hospitalization and reduced independence among our seniors (Canadian Institute for Health Information, 2021). Understanding these challenges is critical for policymakers, healthcare providers, and community organizations aiming to improve the well-being of aging populations.

Healthcare access is a major concern for seniors in Nova Scotia. Many rural communities lack nearby hospitals, specialized care, or at-home care services. It is not uncommon for seniors to need to travel long distances to receive medical attention, creating barriers to time-sensitive and effective care. Furthermore, social isolation is prevalent among rural seniors due to the dispersion of communities and the limited public transportation that Nova Scotia offers. Social isolation is strongly correlated with mental health issues, including depression, anxiety, and increased risks of cognitive decline in our elders (National Seniors Council, 2014).

Unlike urban centers with established public transit systems, many rural communities have limited transportation services. Seniors who are no longer able to drive may struggle to access essential services such as grocery stores, pharmacies, and their medical appointments. Additionally, the limited public transportation across NS is very costly and inconvenient, for example a one way trip on the Maritime bus is $50+. 

Another challenge is our housing crisis, and the lack of accessible homes. Many rural homes are not designed for aging in place, lacking accessibility features such as wheelchair ramps, stairlifts, and walk-in showers. Furthermore, there are long wait times for long-term care facilities, forcing many seniors to either remain in unsuitable housing or relocate away from their communities to receive care.

Overall, these issues require changes to be made in the province we call home. Changes in policies, increased investments in public services, and community support programs are vital to ensure our aging population has a safe place to grow old.
