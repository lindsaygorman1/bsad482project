Nova Scotiaâ€™s rural communities face significant aging-related challenges. Some of these challenges include limited access to healthcare, social isolation, lack of public transportation, and a shortage of accessible housing and long-term care facilities. Seniors often travel long distances for medical care, experience mental health impacts due to isolation, and struggle with costly, insufficient transit options. Many rural homes lack accessibility features, while long-term care waitlists force seniors to remain in unsuitable housing or relocate.
