# The Issues Surrounding Aging Populations in Rural Communities in Nova Scotia
*Lindsay Gorman*


## Executive Summary

Nova Scotiaâ€™s rural communities face significant aging-related challenges. Some of these challenges include limited access to healthcare, social isolation, lack of public transportation, and a shortage of accessible housing and long-term care facilities. Seniors often travel long distances for medical care, experience mental health impacts due to isolation, and struggle with costly, insufficient transit options. Many rural homes lack accessibility features, while long-term care waitlists force seniors to remain in unsuitable housing or relocate.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. Healthcare Accessibility: Percentage of seniors  with access to healthcare facilities within a 30-minute drive. Studies show that better access to healthcare is associated with improved health outcomes. If seniors can reach facilities quickly, they are more likely to attend regular check-ups, follow-ups, and preventive care. This reduces emergency visits and improves long-term health management (Andersen & Davidson, 2013).

2. Social Isolation Rate: Percentage of seniors in rural communities who report feeling socially isolated or lonely.Social isolation has been linked to increased risks of cognitive decline, mental health disorders, and chronic illnesses. Seniors with strong social connections tend to live longer, healthier lives and have lower rates of hospitalization (Holt-Lunstad et al., 2015).

3. Long-Term Care Facilities: Average wait times and availability for placement in long-term care facilities in rural Nova Scotia. Long wait times for long-term care facilities can lead to increased strain on hospitals and family caregivers. Timely access to long-term care improves quality of life for seniors and ensures they receive appropriate medical and personal care support (CIHI, 2023).

4. Access to Public Transportation: Percentage of seniors in rural communities with access to public or community-based transportation services. Reliable transportation is crucial for seniors to access medical care, grocery stores, and social activities. Studies show that seniors without transportation options are at a higher risk of social isolation and reduced healthcare access, leading to poorer health outcomes (Shergold & Parkhurst, 2012).

5. Accessible Housing Availability: Percentage of homes in rural communities with accessibility features for aging in place.  Housing that accommodates aging in place can significantly improve seniors' independence and reduce falls and hospitalizations. Features like wheelchair ramps, stairlifts, and walk-in showers enable seniors to remain in their communities longer and reduce the demand for long-term care facilities (Sixsmith & Sixsmith, 2008).
