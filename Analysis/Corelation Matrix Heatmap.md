### Corelation Matrix Heatmap

Combining KPI's 1 - Healthcare Accessibility and 5 - Accessible Housing Availability, I have created a heatmap to see if there is any coreltaion between my findings above.

The correlation matrix heatmap reveals insights into the relationships between housing accessibility and proximity to healthcare in rural Nova Scotia. There is a strong positive correlation (0.90) between the number of accessible homes and total homes, indicating that counties with more housing overall tend to also have more accessible options. Interestingly, a moderate negative correlation (-0.20) between the percentage of accessible homes and total homes suggests that smaller counties may prioritize accessibility at a higher rate relative to their size. When examining the connection between accessibility and healthcare proximity, there is only a very weak positive correlation (0.09) between the percentage of accessible homes and average distance to the nearest hospital, implying that accessibility improvements are not strongly influenced by healthcare access. Additionally, the average distance to hospital shows moderate negative correlations with both total homes (-0.43) and accessible homes (-0.31), highlighting that more remote areas tend to have fewer housing options overall, including accessible units. These findings suggest that while housing availability plays a role in accessibility, geographic distance from healthcare remains a potential barrier in rural communities.
