1. Elevator/Chair Lift per Municipality

There is a significant disparity in accessibility infrastructure across municipalities, with some regions having far more elevators and chair lifts than others. Cape Breton Regional Municipality has the highest count of elevators or chair lifts, followed by Halifax, indicating better accessibility in these urban areas. In contrast, many smaller municipalities have very few or no accessible infrastructure, which suggests potential challenges for seniors and individuals with mobility impairments. This highlights a clear urban-rural divide, where rural areas may struggle with aging-in-place accessibility due to fewer adapted buildings.

Investments in accessibility infrastructure, such as ramps, stairlifts, and elevators, are necessary in underserved areas to improve mobility and quality of life for seniors. Without these adaptations, seniors in rural communities may face significant barriers in accessing public buildings, healthcare facilities, and other essential services. Policies aimed at subsidizing accessibility upgrades in smaller municipalities could help bridge this gap and ensure more equitable access for all residents.

2. Number of Floors per Municipality

The height of buildings varies across municipalities, which could impact the need for accessibility adaptations such as elevators and chair lifts. Towns like Amherst and Halifax Regional Municipality have a greater number of multi-floor buildings, suggesting a higher potential demand for vertical accessibility solutions. On the other hand, many smaller municipalities have predominantly single or two-story buildings, which may reduce the need for elevators but still require other accessibility features, such as ramps, wider doorways, and step-free entrances. Understanding the distribution of building heights can provide important context for planning accessibility improvements.
Accessibility retrofits may be particularly necessary in towns with taller buildings but a low number of elevators, as residents with mobility issues could struggle with stairs. Even in municipalities where most buildings are single-story, universal design principles should be incorporated into new construction and renovations to support aging-in-place. Ensuring accessibility in all built environments, regardless of height, is essential to fostering inclusivity for seniors and individuals with disabilities.

3. Total Senior Population in the Maritimes (2018-2024)

The senior population in the Maritimes has been steadily increasing over the past several years, reflecting an ongoing demographic shift. This trend indicates a growing demand for senior-focused infrastructure, including healthcare facilities, public transportation, and accessibility upgrades in residential and public buildings. If accessibility improvements do not keep pace with the rising senior population, mobility and healthcare barriers could worsen, particularly in rural areas where services are already limited. Proactively addressing these needs now can help prevent future accessibility challenges.

With the aging population expected to continue growing, more investment is needed in long-term care facilities, community-based transportation services, and housing modifications to support aging in place. Municipalities should begin planning for these future accessibility needs by integrating inclusive design into building codes and expanding services that enable seniors to maintain independence. A strategic approach to senior care and accessibility will ensure that infrastructure and public services evolve to meet the needs of an aging population.
